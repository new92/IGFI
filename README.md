With this script the user by simply logging in, can increase their followers !
Works for both private and public accounts.
And the first time the user uses it can add up to 50 followers ! The other times it can add 25 - 30 followers.
It's suggested to use it every two (2) days in order for your account not to get blocked.

### Question 3

Answer ➡️ No, not at all ! Because it's like asking if following and unfollowing an account is illegal. Although Instagram doesn't suggest using this technique to increase your followers.


### Question 4

- Can my account get blocked by using this script ?

Answer ➡️ Only if you're using a very old version of Instagram. But the script has been tested in several accounts and none of them got blocked.
