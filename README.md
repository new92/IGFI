With IGFI, you can effortlessly increase their followers by simply logging in. **It works seamlessly for both private and public accounts**. Upon the initial use, you can gain up to **50 followers**! Subsequent uses typically result in an addition of 25-30 followers. To maintain account safety, it is recommended to use the script every two (2) days to prevent potential blocking. The script also provides valuable information, including the number and the usernames of the followers added.

### Question 3

- Is illegal to increase followers using script(s) ?

Answer ➡️ No, not at all! It's similar to asking if following and unfollowing an account is illegal, even though Instagram doesn't recommend using this technique to increase your followers.


### Question 4

- Can my account get blocked by using this script ?

Answer ➡️ Only if you're using a very old version of Instagram. But the script has been tested in several accounts and none of them got blocked.
